*NOTE: The intent of this repo is to keep an archive of the BART project for public references, as the program itself has been developed internally and is now property of Royal Bank of Canada (RBC). To that end, NO ACTUAL CODE is shown in this repo, and this README will be the main article that describes the project and its current progress.

# Description

## Context
RBC Amplify is a 4-months intensive program in which students from across Canada gather together in Toronto for one Summer and tackle real challenges provided by different teams and divisions all across the entire RBC. With team leads in the Contact Center department, our team were tasked with coming up to a solution with the following challenge: "How might we leverage AI technologies to reduce clients' average handling time across the Advice Center?"

## Solution
BART (*Bionic Advisor using Real-time Transcription*) is a AI-assisted support system for call center advisors. BART captures the conversation between an call agent and an client and provides real-time transcription of the conversiation and instant procedures and link recommendations.  It provides a real-time transcription of the conversation, and uses it to provide the right procedure at the right time.

The application is fully functional and can be deployed on Mac and Windows. User feedbacks were taken after some testings, and more internal functionalities were implemented after review. According to internal data, BART could provide up to 30% of reduction in clients' average handling time (AHT) as it can minimize the time that the client are put on hold during a call. Put in numbers, this reduction in AHT would result in over CAD 30M$ saved across the entire Advice Centre.

Compared to other similar products from companies such as IBM or Google, BART has the advantage of it being developed in-house by RBC, and it uses a wide range of open source softwares that allows the program to be not only insanely scalable and adaptive, but also secure and protected from data leaks and other cybersecurity risks.

# Result
AmpExpo is the final event of the Amplify program, where students will be able to showcase their projects and celebrate their achievements. 6 teams out of 18 will be chosen as finalists, where they will be able to pitch their solutions to all the attendees, including a panel of judges and some RBC executives. Moreover, 3 major prizes are handed out: The Technical Distinction Award, The Market Disruptor Award, and the Business Impact Award.

**Team BART was not only able to be in one of the six finalist teams, but most importantly, they were also the winner of the Technical Distinction Award for the product's engineering quality, and code cleaniness and craftsmanship.**
